# Contribution guidelines

We believe that our community can develop a documentation for Custom RPG very efficiently.
To make sure we can keep up with doing this, we have set a bunch of rules for what push requests are welcome and which are not.

## What we DO allow:
* Modification of the documentation to reflect a new update
* Clarification of a topic that isn't clear enough or not listed at all
* Correcting a few grammar spelling issues within our documentation

## What we do NOT allow:
* Modification to something that isn't certain
* Unrelated items about the documentation
* Contents which are deemed unsafe for view to minors
* Anything offensive for our community

### Quick note
We prefer anything written with HTML language for websites. We are welcoming `.md` extensions too. If you are uncertain about anything, feel free to ask us!
